== Job Specification Language
Job Specification Language (JSL) specifies a job, its steps, and
directs their execution. The JSL for Jakarta Batch is implemented with XML and
will be henceforth referred to as "Job XML".

=== Job
The 'job' element identifies a job.

Syntax:

[source,xml]
----
 <job id="{name}" restartable="{true|false}">
----

Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|=======================================================================
|id |Specifies the logical _name_ of the job and is used for
identification purposes. It must be a valid XML string value. This is a
required attribute.

|restartable |Specifies whether or not this job is restartable . It must
specify _true_ or _false_. This is an optional attribute. The default is
_true._
|=======================================================================

==== Job Level Listeners

Job level listeners may be configured to a job in order to intercept job
execution. The listener element may be specified as child element of the
job element for this purpose. Job listener is the only listener type
that may be specified as a job level listener.

Multiple listeners may be configured on a job. However, there is no guarantee of the order in which they are invoked.

Syntax:

[source,xml]
----
 <listeners>
  <listener ref="{name}">
  ...
 </listeners>
----

Where:
[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|============================================
|ref |Specifies the name of a batch artifact.
|============================================

===== Job Level Listener Properties

The 'properties' element may be specified as a child element of the
job-level listeners element. It is used to pass property values to a
job listener. Any number of properties may be specified.

Syntax:

[source,xml]
----
 <properties>
  <property name="{property-name}" value="{name-value}"/>
 </properties>
----

Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|=======================================================================
|name |Specifies a unique property name within the current scope. It
must be a valid XML string value. If it matches a named property in the
associated batch artifact, its value is assigned to that property. If
not, it is ignored. This is a required attribute.

|value |Specifies the value corresponding to the named property. It must
be a valid XML string value. This is a required attribute.
|=======================================================================

Example:

[source,xml]
----
 <listener ref="{name}">
  <properties>
   <property name="Property1" value="Property1-Value"/>
  </properties>
 </listener>
----

==== Job Level Exception Handling

Any unhandled exception thrown by a job-level listener causes the job to
terminate with a batch status of FAILED. In this context, "unhandled"
simply means an exception thrown by the listener back to the runtime
implementation.

==== Job Level Properties

The 'properties' element may be specified as a child element of the job
element. It is used to expose properties to any batch artifact belonging
to the job and also to the batch runtime. Any number of properties may
be specified. Job level properties are available through the JobContext
runtime object. See section xref:batch-contexts[9.4] for further information about Job
Context.

Syntax:

[source,xml]
----
 <properties>
   <property name="{property-name}" value="{name-value}"/>
 </properties>
----

Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|=======================================================================
|name |Specifies a unique property name within the current scope. It
must be a valid XML string value. This is a required attribute.

|value |Specifies the value corresponding to the named property. It must
be a valid XML string value. This is a required attribute.
|=======================================================================

=== Step
The 'step' element identifies a job step and its characteristics. Step
is a child element of job. A job may contain any number of steps. Each
step may be either a chunk type step or batchlet type step. See section
xref:chunk[8.2.1] for information on chunk type steps and section xref:batchlet[8.2.2] for
information on batchlet type steps.

Syntax:

[source,xml]
----
 <step id="{name}"
       start-limit="{integer}"
       allow-start-if-complete ="{true|false}"
       next="{flow-id|step-id|split-id|decision-id}">
----

Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|=======================================================================
|id |Specifies the logical _name_ of the step and is used for
identification purposes. It must be a valid XML string value. This is a
required attribute.

|start-limit |Specifies the number of times this step may be started or
restarted. It must be a valid XML integer value. This is an optional
attribute. The default is 0, which means no limit. If the limit is
exceeded, the job is placed in the FAILED state.

|allow-start-if-complete |Specifies whether this step is allowed to
start during job restart, even if the step completed in a previous
execution. It must be _true_ or _false_. A value of _true_ means the
step is allowed to restart. This is an optional attribute. The default
is _false_.

|next |Specifies the next step, flow, split, or decision to run after
this step is complete. It must be a valid XML string value. This is an
optional attribute. The default is this step is the last step in the job
or flow. Note: next attributes cannot be specified such that a loop
occurs among steps.
|=======================================================================

==== Chunk

The 'chunk' element identifies a chunk type step. It is a child element
of the step element. A chunk type step is periodically checkpointed by
the batch runtime according to a configured checkpoint policy. Items
processed between checkpoints are referred to as a "chunk". A single
call is made to the ItemWriter per chunk. Each chunk is processed in a
separate transaction. See section xref:transactionality[9.7] for more details on
transactionality. A chunk that is not complete is restartable from its
last checkpoint. A chunk that is complete and belongs to a step
configured with allow-start-if-complete=true runs from the beginning
when restarted.

Syntax:

[source,xml]
----
 <chunk checkpoint-policy="\{item|custom}"
  item-count="{value}"
  time-limit="{value}"
  skip-limit="{value}"
  retry-limit="{value}" />
----

Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|=======================================================================
|checkpoint-policy |Specifies the checkpoint policy that governs commit
behavior for this chunk. Valid values are: "item" or "custom". The
"item" policy means the chunk is checkpointed after a specified number
of items are processed. The "custom" policy means the chunk is
checkpointed according to a checkpoint algorithm implementation.
Specifying "custom" requires that the checkpoint-algorithm element is
also specified. See section xref:checkpoint-algorithm[8.2.1.5] for checkpoint-algorithm. It is an optional attribute. The default policy is "item".

|item-count |Specifies the number of items to process per chunk when
using the item checkpoint policy. It must be valid XML integer. It is an
optional attribute. The default is 10. The item-count attribute is
ignored for "custom" checkpoint policy.

|time-limit |Specifies the amount of time in seconds before taking a
checkpoint for the item checkpoint policy. It must be valid XML integer.
It is an optional attribute. The default is 0, which means no limit.
When a value greater than zero is specified, a checkpoint is taken when
time-limit is reached or item-count items have been processed, whichever
comes first. The time-limit attribute is ignored for "custom" checkpoint
policy.

|skip-limit |Specifies the number of exceptions a step will skip if any
configured skippable exceptions are thrown by chunk processing. It must
be a valid XML integer value. It is an optional attribute. The default
is no limit.

|retry-limit |Specifies the number of times a step will retry if any
configured retryable exceptions are thrown by chunk processing. It must
be a valid XML integer value. It is an optional attribute. The default
is no limit.
|=======================================================================

===== Reader

The 'reader' element specifies the item reader for a chunk step. It is a
child element of the 'chunk' element. A chunk step must have one and
only one item reader.

Syntax:

[source,xml]
----
 <reader ref="{name}"/>
----

Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|============================================
|ref |Specifies the name of a batch artifact.
|============================================

====== Reader Properties

The 'properties' element may be specified as a child element of the
reader element. It is used to pass property values to a item reader. Any
number of properties may be specified.

Syntax:

[source,xml]
----
  <properties>
    <property name="{property-name}" value="{name-value}"/>
  </properties>
----

Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|=======================================================================
|name |Specifies a unique property name within the current scope. It
must be a valid XML string value. If it matches a named property in the
associated batch artifact, its value is assigned to that property. If
not, it is ignored. This is a required attribute.

|value |Specifies the value corresponding to the named property. It must
be a valid XML string value. This is a required attribute.
|=======================================================================

===== Processor

The 'processor' element specifies the item processor for a chunk step.
It is a child element of the 'chunk' element. The processor element is
optional on a chunk step. Only a single processor element may be
specified.

Syntax:

[source,xml]
----
 <processor ref="{name}"/>
----

Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|============================================
|ref |Specifies the name of a batch artifact.
|============================================

====== Processor Properties

The 'properties' element may be specified as a child element of the
processor element. It is used to pass property values to a item
processor. Any number of properties may be specified.

Syntax:

[source,xml]
----
 <properties>
  <property name="{property-name}" value="{name-value}"/>
 </properties>
----

Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|=======================================================================
|name |Specifies a unique property name within the current scope. It
must be a valid XML string value. If it matches a named property in the
associated batch artifact, its value is assigned to that property. If
not, it is ignored. This is a required attribute.

|value |Specifies the value corresponding to the named property. It must
be a valid XML string value. This is a required attribute.
|=======================================================================

===== Writer

The 'writer' element specifies the item writer for a chunk step. It is a
child element of the 'chunk' element. A chunk type step must have one
and only one item writer.

Syntax:

[source,xml]
----
 <writer ref="{name}"/>
----

Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|============================================
|ref |Specifies the name of a batch artifact.
|============================================

====== Writer Properties

The 'properties' element may be specified as a child element of the
writer element. It is used to pass property values to a item writer. Any
number of properties may be specified.

Syntax:

[source,xml]
----
 <properties>
  <property name="{property-name}" value="{name-value}"/>
 </properties>
----

Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|=======================================================================
|name |Specifies a unique property name within the current scope. It
must be a valid XML string value. If it matches a named property in the
associated batch artifact, its value is assigned to that property. If
not, it is ignored. This is a required attribute.

|value |Specifies the value corresponding to the named property. It must
be a valid XML string value. This is a required attribute.
|=======================================================================

===== Chunk Exception Handling

By default, when any batch artifact that is part of a chunk type step
throws an exception to the Batch Runtime, the job execution ends with a
batch status of FAILED. The default behavior can be overridden for a
reader, processor, or writer artifact by configuring exceptions to skip
or to retry. The default behavior can be overridden for the entire step
by configuring a transition element that matches the step's exit
status.

====== Skipping Exceptions

The skippable-exception-classes element specifies a set of exceptions
that chunk processing will skip. This element is a child element of the
chunk element. It applies to exceptions thrown from the reader,
processor, and writer batch artifacts of a chunk type step. It also applies
to exceptions thrown during checkpoint commit processing. A failed
commit will be treated the same as a failed write. The total number of
skips is set by the skip-limit attribute on the chunk element. See
section xref:chunk[8.2.1] for details on the chunk element.

A given exception will be skipped if it "matches" an include child
element of the skippable-exception-classes element, though this might be
negated (and the exception not skipped) if it also "matches" an exclude
child element of skippable-exception-classes.

The behavior is determined by the "nearest superclass" in the class
hierarchy.

To elaborate, in this context, "matches" means the following: For an
include (or exclude) element C with @class attribute value T, an
exception E "matches" C when either E is of type T or E's type is a
subclass of T.

When an exception E "matches" both one or more include and one or more
exclude elements, then there will be one type T1 among all the matching
include/exclude elements such that all other distinct matching element
types are superclasses of T1 (because of Java's single inheritance). If
T1 only occurs in a matching include element then include (skip) this
exception. If T1 appears in a matching exclude element (even if it also
appears in a matching include element), then exclude (don't skip) this
exception.

Optional Skip Listener batch artifacts can be configured to the step. A
Skip Listener receives control after a skippable exception is thrown by
the reader, processor, or writer. See section xref:skip-listener-interfaces[9.2.7] for details on the
Skip Listener batch interfaces.

Syntax:

[source,xml]
----
 <skippable-exception-classes>
  <include class="{class name}"/>
  <exclude class="{class name}"/>
 </skippable-exception-classes>
----

Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|=======================================================================
|include class |Specifies the class name of an exception or exception
superclass to skip. It must be a fully qualified class name. Multiple
instances of the include element may be specified. The include child
element is optional. However, when specified, the class attribute is
required.

|exclude class |Specifies a class name of an exception or exception
superclass to not skip. 'Exclude class' reduces the number of exceptions
eligible to skip as specified by 'include class'. It must be a fully
qualified class name. Multiple instances of the exclude element may be
specified. The exclude child element is optional. However, when
specified, the class attribute is required.
|=======================================================================

Example:

[source,xml]
----
 <skippable-exception-classes>
  <include class="java.lang.Exception"/>
  <exclude class="java.io.FileNotFoundException"/>
 </skippable-exception-classes>
----

The preceding example would skip all exceptions except
`java.io.FileNotFoundException`, (along with any subclasses of
`java.io.FileNotFoundException`).

====== Retrying Exceptions

The retryable-exception-classes element specifies a set of exceptions
that chunk processing will retry. This element is a child element of the
chunk element. It applies to exceptions thrown from the reader,
processor, or writer batch artifacts of a chunk type step. It also
applies to exceptions thrown by checkpoint commit processing. The total
number of retry attempts is set by the retry-limit attribute on the
chunk element. See section xref:chunk[8.2.1] for details on the chunk element.

The list of exceptions that will be retried (or not retried) is
specified in the retryable-exception-classes element on the child
include element. This list, however, may be modified using one or more
child exclude elements. The rules for deciding whether to retry or not
retry a given exception when a combination of include and exclude
elements are used are analogous to the rules described in the discussion
in section xref:skipping-exceptions[8.2.1.4.1] for skipping exceptions.

Optional Retry Listener batch artifacts can be configured on the step. A
Retry Listener receives control after a retryable exception is thrown by
the reader, processor, or writer. See section xref:retrylistener-interface[9.2.8] for details on the
Retry Listener batch artifact.


Syntax:

[source,xml]
----
 <retryable-exception-classes>
  <include class="{class name}"/>
  <exclude class="{class name}"/>
 </retryable-exception-classes>
----

Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|=======================================================================
|include class |Specifies a class name of an exception or exception
superclass to retry. It must be a fully qualified class name. Multiple
instances of the include element may be specified. The include child
element is optional. However, when specified, the class attribute is
required.

|exclude class |Specifies a class name of an exception or exception
superclass to not retry. 'Exclude class' reduces the number of
exceptions eligible for retry as specified by 'include class'. It must
be a fully qualified class name. Multiple instances of the include
element may be specified. The exclude child element is optional.
However, when specified, the class attribute is required.
|=======================================================================

Example:

[source,xml]
----
 <retryable-exception-classes>
  <include class="java.io.IOException"/>
  <exclude class="java.io.FileNotFoundException"/>
 </retryable-exception-classes>
----

The result is that all IOExceptions except `FileNotFoundException` (and
its subclasses) would be retried.

====== Retry and Skip the Same Exception

When the same exception is specified as both retryable and skippable,
retryable takes precedence over skippable during regular processing of
the chunk. While the chunk is retrying, skippable takes precedence over
retryable since the exception is already being retried.

This allows an exception to initially be retried for the entire chunk
and then skipped if it recurs. When retrying with default retry behavior
(see section xref:default-retry-behavior-rollback[8.2.1.4.4]) the skips can occur for individual items, since
the retry is done with an item-count of 1.

====== Default Retry Behavior - Rollback

When a retryable exception occurs, the default behavior is for the batch
runtime to rollback the current chunk and re-process it with an
item-count of 1 and a checkpoint policy of item. If the optional
ChunkListener is configured on the step, the onError method is called
before rollback. The default retry behavior can be overridden by
configuring the no-rollback-exception-classes element. See section
xref:preventing-rollback-during-retry[8.2.1.4.5] for more information on specifying no-rollback exceptions.

====== Preventing Rollback During Retry

The no-rollback-exception-classes element specifies a list of exceptions
that override the default behavior of rollback for retryable exceptions.
This element is a child element of the chunk element. If a retryable
exception is thrown the default behavior is to rollback before retry. If
an exception is specified as both a retryable and a no-rollback
exception, then no rollback occurs and the current operation is retried.
Retry Listeners, if configured, are invoked. See section xref:retrylistener-interface[9.2.8] for
details on the Retry Listener batch artifact.

The rules for determining whether a combination of include and exclude
child elements of no-rollback-exception-classes results in the "no
rollback" behavior or not are analogous to the rules described in the
discussion in section xref:skipping-exceptions[8.2.1.4.1] for skipping exceptions.

Syntax:

[source,xml]
----
 <no-rollback-exception-classes>
  <include class="{class name}"/>
  <exclude class="{class name}"/>
 </no-rollback-exception-classes>
----
Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|=======================================================================
|include class |Specifies a class name of an exception or exception
superclass for which rollback will not occur during retry processing. It
must be a fully qualified class name. Multiple instances of the include
element may be specified. The include child element is optional.
However, when specified, the class attribute is required.

|exclude class |Specifies a class name of an exception or exception
superclass for which rollback will occur during retry processing. It
must be a fully qualified class name. Multiple instances of the include
element may be specified. The exclude child element is optional.
However, when specified, the class attribute is required.
|=======================================================================

===== Checkpoint Algorithm

The checkpoint-algorithm element specifies an optional custom checkpoint
algorithm. It is a child element of the chunk element. It is valid when
the chunk element checkpoint-policy attribute specifies the value
'custom'. A custom checkpoint algorithm may be used to provide a
checkpoint decision based on factors other than only number of items, or
amount of time. See section xref:checkpointalgorithm-interface[9.1.1.4] for further information about custom
checkpoint algorithms.

Syntax:

[source,xml]
----
 <checkpoint-algorithm ref="{name}"/>
----

Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|============================================
|ref |Specifies the name of a batch artifact.
|============================================

====== Checkpoint Algorithm Properties

The 'properties' element may be specified as a child element of the
checkpoint algorithm element. It is used to pass property values to a
checkpoint algorithm. Any number of properties may be specified.

Syntax:

[source,xml]
----
 <properties>
  <property name="{property-name}" value="{name-value}"/>
 </properties>
----

Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Specifies a unique property name within the current scope. It
must be a valid XML string value. If it matches a named property in the
associated batch artifact, its value is assigned to that property. If
not, it is ignored. This is a required attribute.

|Value |Specifies the value corresponding to the named property. It must
be a valid XML string value. This is a required attribute.
|=======================================================================

==== Batchlet

The batchlet element specifies a task-oriented batch step. It is
specified as a child element of the step element. It is mutually
exclusive with the chunk element. See xref:-batchlet-interface[9.1.2] for further details about
batchlets. Steps of this type are useful for performing a variety of
tasks that are not item-oriented, such as executing a command or doing
file transfer.

Syntax:

[source,xml]
----
 <batchlet ref="{name}"/>
----

Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|============================================
|Ref |Specifies the name of a batch artifact.
|============================================

===== Batchlet Exception Handling

This section is superseded by section xref:step-exception-handling[8.2.7].

===== Batchlet Properties

The 'properties' element may be specified as a child element of the
batchlet element. It is used to pass property values to a batchlet. Any
number of properties may be specified.

Syntax:

[source,xml]
----
 <properties>
  <property name="{property-name}" value="{name-value}"/>
 </properties>
----

Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Specifies a unique property name within the current scope. It
must be a valid XML string value. If it matches a named property in the
associated batch artifact, its value is assigned to that property. If
not, it is ignored. This is a required attribute.

|value |Specifies the value corresponding to the named property. It must
be a valid XML string value. This is a required attribute.
|=======================================================================

==== Step Level Properties

The 'properties' element may be specified as a child element of the step
element. It is used to expose properties to any step level batch
artifact and also to the batch runtime. Any number of properties may be
specified. Step level properties are available through the StepContext
runtime object. See section xref:batch-contexts[9.4] for further information about
StepContext.

Syntax:

[source,xml]
----
 <properties>
  <property name="{property-name}" value="{name-value}"/>
 </properties>
----

Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|=======================================================================
|name |Specifies a unique property name within the current scope. It
must be a valid XML string value. This is a required attribute.

|value |Specifies the value corresponding to the named property. It must
be a valid XML string value. This is a required attribute.
|=======================================================================

==== Step Level Listeners

Step level listeners may be configured to a job step in order to
intercept step execution. The listener element may be specified as child
element of the step element for this purpose. The following listener
types may be specified according to step type:

* chunk step - step listener, item read listener, item process listener,
item write listener, chunk listener, skip listener, and retry listener
* batchlet step - step listener

Multiple listeners may be configured on a step. However, there is no
guarantee of the order in which they are invoked.

Syntax:

[source,xml]
----
 <listeners>
  <listener ref="{name}">
  ...
 </listeners>
----

Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|============================================
|ref |Specifies the name of a batch artifact.
|============================================

===== Step Level Listener Properties

The 'properties' element may be specified as a child element of the
step-level listeners element. It is used to pass property values to a
step listener. Any number of properties may be specified.

Syntax:

[source,xml]
----
 <properties>
  <property name="{property-name}" value="{name-value}"/>
 </properties>
----

Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|=======================================================================
|name |Specifies a unique property name within the current scope. It
must be a valid XML string value. If it matches a named property in the
associated batch artifact, its value is assigned to that property. If
not, it is ignored. This is a required attribute.

|value |Specifies the value corresponding to the named property. It must
be a valid XML string value. This is a required attribute.
|=======================================================================

Example:

[source,xml]
----
 <listener ref="{name}">
  <properties>
   <property name="Property1" value="Property1-Value"/>
  </properties>
 </listener>
----

==== Step Sequence

The first step, flow, or split defines the first step (flow or split) to
execute for a given Job XML. "First" means first according to order of
occurrence as the Job XML document is parsed from beginning to end. The
'next' attribute on the step, flow, or split defines what executes next.
The next attribute may specify a step, flow, split, or decision. For the
purpose of discussing transitioning it is convenient to group these four
with the term "execution elements". The next attribute is supported on
step, flow, and split elements. Steps, flows, and decisions may also
 use the "next" _element_ to specify what executes
next. The next attribute and next element may not be used in a way that
allows for looping among job execution elements.

Syntax:

[source,xml]
----
 <next on="{exit status}" to="{id}" />
----

Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|=======================================================================
|on |Specifies an exit status to match to the current next element. It
must be a valid XML string value. Wildcards of "*" and "" may be used.
"*" matches zero or more characters. "" matches exactly one character.
It must match an exit status value in order to have effect. This is a
required attribute.

|to |Specifies the id of another step, split, flow, or decision, which
will execute next. It must be a valid XML string value. It must match an
id of another step, split, flow, or decision in the same job. For a step
inside a flow, the id must match another step in the same flow. This is
a required attribute.
|=======================================================================

See section  xref:transition-elements[8.6] for more details about transition
elements and section xref:transitioning-rules[8.9] for details on transitioning rules.

==== Step Partitioning

A batch step may run as a partitioned step. A partitioned step runs as
multiple instances of the same step definition across multiple threads,
one partition per thread. The number of partitions and the number of
threads is controlled through either a static specification in the Job
XML or through a batch artifact called a partition mapper. Each
partition needs the ability to receive unique parameters to instruct it
which data on which to operate. Properties for each partition may be
specified statically in the Job XML or through the optional partition
mapper. Since each thread runs a separate copy of the step, chunking and
checkpointing occur independently on each thread for chunk type steps.

There is an optional way to coordinate these separate units of work in a
partition reducer so that backout is possible if one or more partitions
experience failure. The PartitionReducer batch artifact provides a way
to do that. A PartitionReducer provides programmatic control over
logical unit of work demarcation that scopes all partitions of a
partitioned step.

The partitions of a partitioned step may need to share results with a
control point to decide the overall outcome of the step. The
PartitionCollector and PartitionAnalyzer batch artifact pair provide for
this need.

The 'partition' element specifies that a step is a partitioned step. The
partition element is a child element of the 'step' element. It is an
optional element.

Syntax:

[source,xml]
----
 <partition>
----

Example:

The following Job XML snippet shows how to specify a partitioned step:

[source,xml]
----
 <step id="Step1">
  <chunk .../> or <batchlet ... />
  <partition .../>
 </step>
----

===== Partition Plan

A partition plan defines several configuration attributes that affect
partitioned step execution. A partition plan specifies the number of
partitions, the number of partitions to execute concurrently, and the
properties for each partition. A partition plan may be defined in a Job
XML declaratively or dynamically at runtime with a partition mapper.

The 'plan' element is a child element of the 'partition' element. The
'plan' element is mutually exclusive with partition mapper element. See
section xref:partitionmapper-interface[9.5.1] for further details on partition mapper.

Note the specification does not attempt to guarantee order of partition
execution with respect to the order within a statically or
dynamically-defined plan.

Syntax:

[source,xml]
----
 <plan partitions="{number}" threads="{number}"/>

Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|=======================================================================
|Partitions |Specifies the number of partitions for this partitioned
step. This is a an optional attribute. The default is 1.

|threads |Specifies the maximum number of threads on which to execute
the partitions of this step. Note the batch runtime cannot guarantee the
requested number of threads are available; it will use as many as it can
up to the requested maximum. This is an optional attribute. The default
is the number of partitions.
|=======================================================================

Example:

The following Job XML snippet shows how to specify a step partitioned
into 3 partitions on 2 threads:

[source,xml]
----
 <step id="Step1">
   <chunk .../>
   <partition>
     <plan partitions="3" threads="2"/>
   </partition>
 </step>
----

===== Partition Properties

When defining a statically partitioned step, it is possible to specify
unique property values to pass to each partition directly in the Job XML
using the property element. See section xref:partitionmapper-interface[9.5.1] for further information on
partition mapper.

Syntax:

[source,xml]
----
 <properties partition="{partition-number}">
  <property name="{property-name}" value="{name-value}"/>
 </properties>
----

Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|=======================================================================
|partition |Specifies the logical partition number to which the
specified properties apply. This must be a non-negative integer value,
starting at 0.

|name |Specifies a unique property name within the current
scope . It must be a valid XML string value. If
it matches a named property in the associated batch artifact, its value
is assigned to that property. If not, it is ignored. This is a required
attribute.

|value |Specifies the value corresponding to the named property. It must
be a valid XML string value. This is a required attribute.
|=======================================================================

Example:

The following Job XML snippet shows a step of 2 partitions with a unique
value for the property named "filename" for each partition:

[source,xml]
----
 <partition>
  <plan partitions="2">
   <properties partition="0">
    <property name="filename" value="/tmp/file1.txt"/>
   </properties>
   <properties partition="1">
    <property name="filename" value="/tmp/file2.txt"/>
   </properties>
  </plan>
 </partition>
----

===== Partition Mapper

The partition mapper provides a programmatic means for calculating the
number of partitions and threads for a partitioned step. The partition
mapper also specifies the properties for each partition. The mapper
element specifies a reference to a PartitionMapper batch artifact; see
section xref:partitionmapper-interface[9.5.1] for further information. Note the mapper element is
mutually exclusive with the plan element.

Syntax:

[source,xml]
----
 <mapper ref="{name}">
----

Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|============================================
|ref |Specifies the name of a batch artifact.
|============================================
Example:

[source,xml]
----
 <partition>
  <mapper ref="MyStepPartitioner"/>
 </partition>
----

====== Mapper Properties
The 'properties' element may be specified as a child element of the
mapper element. It is used to pass property values to a PartitionMapper
batch artifact. Any number of properties may be specified.

Syntax:

[source,xml]
----
 <properties>
  <property name="{property-name}" value="{name-value}"/>
 </properties>
----

Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|=======================================================================
|name |Specifies a unique property name within the current scope. It
must be a valid XML string value. If it matches a named property in the
associated batch artifact, its value is assigned to that property. If
not, it is ignored. This is a required attribute.

|value |Specifies the value corresponding to the named property. It must
be a valid XML string value. This is a required attribute.
|=======================================================================

===== Partition Reducer

A partitioned step may execute with an optional partition reducer. A
partition reducer provides a kind of unit of work demarcation around the
processing of the partitions. Programmatic interception of the
partitioned step's lifecycle is possible through the partition reducer.
The reducer element specifies a reference to a PartitionReducer batch
artifact; see section xref:partitionreducer-interface[9.5.2] for further information.

The 'reducer' element is a child element of the 'partition' element.

Syntax:

[source,xml]
----
 <reducer ref="{name}">
----
Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|============================================
|ref |Specifies the name of a batch artifact.
|============================================
Example:

[source,xml]
----
 <partition>
 <reducer ref="MyStepPartitionReducer"/>
 </partition>
----

====== Partition Reducer Properties
The 'properties' element may be specified as a child element of the
PartitionReducer element. It is used to pass property values to a
PartitionReducer batch artifact. Any number of properties may be
specified.

Syntax:

Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|=======================================================================
|name |Specifies a unique property name within the current scope. It
must be a valid XML string value. If it matches a named property in the
associated batch artifact, its value is assigned to that property. If
not, it is ignored. This is a required attribute.

|value |Specifies the value corresponding to the named property. It must
be a valid XML string value. This is a required attribute.
|=======================================================================

===== Partition Collector

A Partition Collector is useful for sending intermediary results for
analysis from each partition to the step's Partition Analyzer. A
separate Partition Collector instance runs on each thread executing a
partition of the step. The collector is invoked at the conclusion of
each checkpoint for chunking type steps and again at the end of
partition; it is invoked once at the end of partition for batchlet type
steps. A collector returns a Java Serializable object, which is
delivered to the step's Partition Analyzer. See section xref:partitionanalyzer-interface[9.5.4] for
further information about the Partition Analyzer. The collector element
specifies a reference to a PartitionCollector batch artifact; see
section xref:partitioncollector-interface[9.5.3] for further information.

The 'collector' element is a child element of the 'partition' element.

Syntax:

[source,xml]
----
 <collector ref="{name}">
----

Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|============================================
|ref |Specifies the name of a batch artifact.

 <partition>
  <collector ref="MyStepCollector"/>
 </partition>

 </properties>
----

Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|=======================================================================
|name |Specifies a unique property name within the current scope. It
must be a valid XML string value. If it matches a named property in the
associated batch artifact, its value is assigned to that property. If
not, it is ignored. This is a required attribute.

|value |Specifies the value corresponding to the named property. It must
be a valid XML string value. This is a required attribute.
|=======================================================================

===== Partition Analyzer

A Partition Analyzer receives intermediary results from each partition
sent via the step's Partition Collector. A Partition analyzer runs on
the step main thread and serves as a collection point for this data. The
PartitionAnalyzer also receives control with the partition exit status
for each partition, after that partition ends. An analyzer can be used
to implement custom exit status handling for the step, based on the
results of the individual partitions. The analyzer element specifies a
reference to a PartitionAnalyzer batch artifact; see section xref:partitionanalyzer-interface[9.5.4] for
further information.

Syntax:

[source,xml]
----
 <analyzer ref="{name}">
----

Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|============================================
|ref |Specifies the name of a batch artifact.
|============================================

Example:

[source,xml]
----
 <partition>
  <analyzer ref="MyStepAnalyzer"/>
 </partition>
----

====== Partition Analyzer Properties
The 'properties' element may be specified as a child element of the
analyzer element. It is used to pass property values to a
PartitionAnalyzer batch artifact. Any number of properties may be
specified.

Syntax:

[source,xml]
----
 <properties>
  <property name="{property-name}" value="{name-value}"/>
 </properties>
----

Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|=======================================================================
|name |Specifies a unique property name within the current scope. It
must be a valid XML string value. If it matches a named property in the
associated batch artifact, its value is assigned to that property. If
not, it is ignored. This is a required attribute.

|value |Specifies the value corresponding to the named property. It must
be a valid XML string value. This is a required attribute.
|=======================================================================



==== Step Exception Handling

Any unhandled exception thrown by any step-level artifact during step
processing causes the step to terminate with a batch status of FAILED.
In this context, "unhandled" means an exception thrown by the execution
of the artifact back to the runtime implementation which does not result
in a skip or a retry as described in section xref:chunk-exception-handling[8.2.1.4].
 See section xref:transitioning-precedence-rules[8.9.2] for complete details on
transitioning after an unhandled exception.

=== Flow

A flow defines a sequence of execution elements that execute together as
a unit. When the flow is finished, it is the entire flow that
transitions to the next execution element. A flow may transition to a
step, split, decision, or another flow. A flow may contain step, flow,
decision, and split execution elements. See section xref:decision[8.5] for more on
decisions. See section xref:split[8.4] for more on splits. The execution elements
within a flow may only transition among themselves; they may not
transition to elements outside of the flow. A flow may also contain the
transition elements next, stop, fail, and end. See section xref:transition-elements[8.6] for more
on transition elements.

Syntax:

[source,xml]
----
 <flow id="{name}"next="{flow-id|step-id|split-id|decision-id}">
  <step> ... </step> ...
 </flow>
----

Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|=======================================================================
|id |Specifies the logical _name_ of the flow and is used for
identification purposes. It must be a valid XML string value. This is a
required attribute.

|next |Specifies the next step, flow, split, or decision to run after
this step is complete. It must be a valid XML string value. This is an
optional attribute. The default is this flow is the last execution
element in the job. Note: next attributes cannot be specified such that
a loop occurs among steps.
|=======================================================================

=== Split

A split defines a set of flows that execute concurrently. A split may
include only flow elements as children. See section xref:flow[8.3] for more on
flows. Each flow runs on a separate thread. The split is finished after
all flows complete. When the split is finished, it is the entire split
that transitions to the next execution element. A split may transition
to a step, flow, decision, or another split.

Syntax:

[source,xml]
----
 <split id="{name}"next="{flow-id|step-id|split-id|decision-id}">
  <flow> ... </flow>
  ...
 </split>
----

Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|=======================================================================
|id |Specifies the logical _name_ of the split and is used for
identification purposes. It must be a valid XML string value. This is a
required attribute.

|next |Specifies the next step, flow, split, or decision to run after
this step is complete. It must be a valid XML string value. This is an
optional attribute. The default is this split is the last execution
element in the job. Note: next attributes cannot be specified such that
a loop occurs among steps.
|=======================================================================

==== Split Termination Processing Incomplete

The effort of the initial 1.0 final release specification to define
split termination processing is recognized as incomplete. This is
related to the recognition that flow transitioning is incomplete
(section xref:flow-level-transitions-undefined[8.9.5]).

As such, there is no well-defined mechanism for "passing back" status
from the individual child flows of a split and aggregating them into a
status at the split level. There is, accordingly, no termination based
on the status of the constituent flows performed after a split
execution.

However, the implementor must be aware that a split may have a child
flow where the flow itself or a flows child (step, decision, etc.)
causes the job execution to terminate. This could be via an end, stop,
or fail transition element, or via an unhandled exception.

In such a case the job should then cease execution before transitioning
past the current, containing split, on to the next execution element.

Typically only one such element (in one single flow) would terminate job
execution, with a corresponding batch and exit status that would then be
set by the implementation as the job-level batch status and exit status,
since typically the whole split would be intended to complete.

The spec does not make an effort, then, to define the outcome if more
than one flow within a split produced a terminating status. A
suggestion, though, is that a FAILED batch status should be given
preference to STOPPED, which should be given preference to COMPLETED
status, and a natural corollary might be to bubble up the associate exit
status as the job-level exit status as well.

=== Decision

A decision provides a customized way of determining sequencing among
steps, flows, and splits. The decision element may follow a step, flow,
or split. A job may contain any number of decision elements. A decision
element is the target of the "next" attribute from a job-level step,
flow, split, or another decision. A decision must supply a decider batch
artifact (see section xref:decider-interface[9.6]). The decider's purpose is to decide the next
transition. The decision uses any of the transition elements, stop,
fail, end, and next elements to select the next transition. See section
xref:transition-elements[8.6] for further information on transition elements. The decider return
value will also be set as the current value of the job exit status, in
addition to being matched against the decisions own child transition
elements to decide the next transition.

Syntax:

[source,xml]
----
 <decision id="{name}" ref="{ref-name}">
----

Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|=======================================================================
|id |Specifies the logical _name_ of the decision and is used for
identification purposes. It must be a valid XML string value. This is a
required attribute.

|ref |Specifies the name of a batch artifact.
|=======================================================================
Example:

[source,xml]
----
 <decision id="AfterFlow1" ref="MyDecider">
 ...
 </decision>
----

==== Decision Properties

The 'properties' element may be specified as a child element of the
decision element. It is used to pass property values to a decider. Any
number of properties may be specified.

Syntax:

[source,xml]
----
 <properties>
  <property name="{property-name}" value="{name-value}"/>
 </properties>
----

Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|=======================================================================
|name |Specifies a unique property name within the current scope. It
must be a valid XML string value. If it matches a named property in the
associated batch artifact, its value is assigned to that property. If
not, it is ignored. This is a required attribute.

|value |Specifies the value corresponding to the named property. It must
be a valid XML string value. This is a required attribute.
|=======================================================================

==== Decision Exception Handling

Any exception thrown by a batch artifact invoked during decision
handling will end the job with a batch status of FAILED. This exception
is visible to job-level listeners.

=== Transition Elements

Transition elements may be specified in the containment scope of a step,
flow, or decision (but not a split) to direct job execution sequence or
to terminate job execution. There are fo ur
transition elements:

1.  next - directs execution flow to the next execution element.
2.  fail - causes a job to end with FAILED batch status.
3.  end - causes a job to end with COMPLETED batch status.
4.  stop - causes a job to end with STOPPED batch status.

Fail, end, and stop are considered "terminating elements" because they
cause a job execution to terminate.

==== Next Element
The next element is used to transition execution to the next execution element.
Multiple next elements may be specified in the current containment
scope.
Syntax:

[source,xml]
----
 <next on="{exit status}" to="{step id | flow id | split id}"/>
----

Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|=======================================================================
|on |Specifies the exit status value that activates this end element. It
must be a valid XML string value. Wildcards of "*" and "" may be used.
"*" matches zero or more characters. "" matches exactly one character.
It must match an exit status value in order to have effect. This is a
required attribute.

|to |Specifies the execution element  to which
to transition after this decision. It must be a valid XML string value.
This is a required attribute. Note: the to value cannot specify the next
execution element such that a loop occurs in the batch job.
|=======================================================================
Example:

[source,xml]
----
<step id="Step1">
 <next on="*" to="Step2"/>
</step>
----

==== Fail Element

The fail element is used to terminate the job at the conclusion of the
current step or flow. The job  batch status is
set to FAILED. This does not, however, directly affect the batch status
of the step containing the fail element.
 Multiple fail elements may be specified in the
current containment scope. The fail element is supported as a child of
the step, flow, and decision elements.

Syntax:

[source,xml]
----
 <fail on="{exit status}" exit-status="{exit status}"/>
----

Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|=======================================================================
|on |Specifies the exit status value that activates this fail element.
It must be a valid XML string value. Wildcards of "*" and "" may be
used. "*" matches zero or more characters. "" matches exactly one
character. It must match an exit status value in order to have effect.
This is a required attribute.

|exit-status |Specifies the new exit status for the job. It
 must be a valid XML string value. This is an
optional attribute. If not specified, the job-level exit status is
unchanged. This attribute does not directly change any step exit status
(particularly the step which contains  this
fail element).
|=======================================================================

Example:
[source,xml]
----
<step id="Step1">
 <fail on="FAILED" exit-status="EARLY COMPLETION"/>
</step>
----

==== End Element

The end element is used to terminate the job at the current step. The
job  batch status is set to COMPLETED. This does
not, however, directly affect the batch status of the step containing
the  end element. Multiple end elements may be
specified in the current containment scope. The end element is supported
as a child of the step, flow, and decision elements.

Syntax:

[source,xml]
----
 <end on="{exit status}" exit-status="{exit status}"/>
----

Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|=======================================================================
|on |Specifies the exit status value that activates this end element. It
must be a valid XML string value. Wildcards of "*" and "" may be used.
"*" matches zero or more characters. "" matches exactly one character.
It must match an exit status value in order to have effect. This is a
required attribute.

|exit-status |Specifies the new exit status for the job. It
 must be a valid XML string value. This is an
optional attribute. If not specified, the job-level exit status is
unchanged. This attribute does not directly change any step exit status
(particularly the step which contains  this end
element).
|=======================================================================

Example:

[source,xml]
----
 <step id="Step1">
  <end on="COMPLETED" exit-status="EARLY COMPLETION">
 </step>
----

==== Stop Element

The stop element is used to terminate the job after the current step or
flow. If the stop element matches the exit status, the job-level batch
status is then set to STOPPED. This does not, however, directly affect
the batch status of the step containing the
 .
Multiple stop elements may be specified in the current containment
scope. The stop element is supported as a child of step, flow, and
decision elements.

[source,xml]
----
<stop on="{exit status}" exit-status="{exit status}" restart="{step id | flow id | split id}"/>
----

Where:

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",]
|=======================================================================
|on |Specifies the exit status value that activates this end element. It
must be a valid XML string value. Wildcards of "*" and "" may be used.
"*" matches zero or more characters. "" matches exactly one character.
It must match an exit status value in order to have effect. This is a
required attribute.

|exit-status |Specifies the exit status for the job. It
 must be a valid XML string value. This is an
optional attribute. If not specified, the job-level exit status is
unchanged. This attribute does not directly change any step exit status
(particularly the step which contains  this
stop element).

|restart |Specifies the job-level step, flow, or split at which to
restart when the job is restarted. It must be a valid XML string value.
This is an optional attribute.
|=======================================================================

Example:

[source,xml]
----
 <step id="Step1">
  <stop on="COMPLETED" restart="step2"/>
 </step>
----

=== Batch and Exit Status

Batch execution reflects a sequence of state changes, culminating in an
end state after a job has terminated. These state changes apply to the
entire job as a whole, as well as to each step within the job. These
state changes are exposed through the programming model as status
values. There is both a runtime status value, called "batch status", as
well as a user-defined value, called "exit status".

A job and each step in a job end with a batch status and exit status
value. Batch status is set by the batch runtime; exit status may be set
through the Job XML or by the batch application. The exit status for a
job  and a step will be initially set to null.
At the time that the job or step completes execution, if the exit status
is equal to null, it will then be set by the runtime implementation
 to the string value of the batch status, which
will be its final value. The batch and exit status values are available
in the JobContext and StepContext runtime objects, and the exit status
can be set explicitly via any batch artifact. The overall batch and exit
status for the job are available through the JobOperator interface.
Batch and exit status values are strings. The following batch status
values are defined:

|=======================================================================
|Value|Meaning
|STARTING|Batch job has been passed to the batch runtime for execution through the JobOperator interface start or restart operation. A step has a status of STARTING before it actually begins execution.
|STARTED|Batch job has begun execution by the batch runtime. A step has a status of STARTED once it has begun execution.
|STOPPING|Batch job has been requested to stop through the JobOperator interface
stop operation or by a <stop> element in the Job XML. A step has a
status of STOPPING as soon as JobOperator.stop receives control.
|STOPPED|Batch job has been stopped through the JobOperator interface stop
operation or by a <stop> element in the Job XML. A step has a status of
STOPPED once it has actually been stopped by the batch runtime.
|FAILED|Batch job has ended due to an unresolved exception or by a <fail>
element in the Job XML. A step has a status of FAILED under the same
conditions.
|COMPLETED|Batch job has ended normally or by an <end> element in the Job XML. A
step has a status of COMPLETED under the same conditions.
|ABANDONED|Batch job has been marked abandoned through the JobOperator interface
abandon operation. An abandoned job is still visible through the
JobOperator interface, but is not running, nor can it be restarted. It
exists only as a matter of history.
|=======================================================================

A job execution will end under the following conditions:

. A job-level execution element (step, flow, or split) finishes
execution, without specifying a "next" attribute and without the exit
status matching any transition elements. (See section xref:transitioning-precedence-rules[8.9.2] for
details).  In this case, the batch status is set
to COMPLETED.
. A step throws an exception to the batch runtime that does not match
skip or retry criteria, with the exit status not matching any transition
elements. In this case, the batch status is set to FAILED. (See section
xref:transitioning-precedence-rules[8.9.2] for details).  In the case of partitioned
or concurrent (split) step execution, all other still-running parallel
instances are allowed to complete before the job ends with FAILED batch
status.
. A step, flow, or decision terminates execution with a stop, end, or
fail element. In this case, the batch status is STOPPED, COMPLETED, or
FAILED, respectively .

The batch and exit status of the job is set as follows:

. Batch status is initially set to STARTING by the batch runtime.
Immediately before starting the first step, the batch runtime sets the
batch status to STARTED .
. Exit status can be overridden by any artifact by invoking the exit
status setter method on the JobContext object.
. Exit status can be overridden by a decision element.
. Exit status can be overridden by a terminating transition element on
a step, flow, or split. See section xref:transition-elements[8.6].
. Final batch status is set by the batch runtime depending on the
outcome of the job. See table above. Exit status is set to the final
batch status if it was not overridden by any of the override means
described earlier in this list. Note the last override to set exit
status during the course of job execution takes precedence over all
others.

In addition to  these conditions and events
which are well-defined by this specification, it is also recognized that
the runtime may be forced to make another transition of job and step
batch status.

For example, a JVM hang may cause a job to appear in STARTED state even
though it is no longer running. The specification forbids running
multiple executions of a given job instance at the same time. In order
to recover and allow restart it is expect that a batch runtime
implementation might provide a mechanism to automatically or through
user intervention mark the appropriate job and step execution(s) as
FAILED (i.e. set the batch status as FAILED).

The details are left entirely to the implementation, we are just
recognizing here that this is a valid state transition.

==== Batch and Exit Status for Steps

Step batch status is set initially, and then again at the conclusion of
the step, by the batch runtime. [line-through]#Step exit status is
initially set to the same value as batch
status.#  Step exit status may be set by any
batch artifact configured to the step by invoking the exit status setter
method in the StepContext object. See section xref:batch-contexts[9.4] for further
information about the StepContext object. Setting the step exit status
does not alter the execution of the current step, but rather, is
available to influence the execution of subsequent steps via transition
elements (see xref:transition-elements[8.6]) and deciders (see xref:decider-interface[9.6]). If no batch artifact sets the
exit status, the batch runtime will default the value to the string form
of the batch status value of the step when step execution completes.
An important point to note is that transition elements do not affect the
batch and exit status of their containing step (for a step with one or
more child transition elements), but only potentially affect the batch
and exit status of the job.

Example:
[source,xml]
----
<step id="FS1">
 <batchlet >
  <next on="RC0" />
  <fail on="RC4" exit-status="BAD"/>
  <fail on="RC8" />
</step>
----

Suppose for the above example JSL snippet, FS1s batchlet executes
normally with an exit status of "RC4". Then step FS1s batch status will
end up as COMPLETED, and FS1s exit status will end up as "RC4". The jobs
batch status will end up as FAILED and the jobs exit status will end up
as "BAD". Likewise, if the batchlet completes with an exit status of
"RC8" the steps batch and exit status will be COMPLETED and "RC8",
respectively, while the jobs batch and exit status will be FAILED and
"FAILED" (assuming the job exit status hasnt been set and defaults in
this case).

Note the implications for restart processing. For example, a completed
step wont re-run just because the step includes a transition element
failing the job on the original step executions exit status. See section
xref:restart-processing[10.8] for more on restart processing.

==== Exit Status for Partitioned Steps

The exit status for a partitioned step follows the same rules as for a
regular step except for an exit status set by batch artifacts processing
individual partitions . This means any batch
artifact running on the main thread of the partitioned step can set the
steps exit status via the exit status setter method on the StepContext
object , the same as for a non-partitioned step.E.g. a steps partition
analyzer, partition reducer, or step listener could each potentially set
the steps exit status in this simple manner (since each of these
artifacts run on the initial thread, not the threads processing an
individual partition). If the exit status is not set it defaults to
batch status at the end of step execution , the
same as for a non-partitioned step.

For a partitioned batchlet, each thread processing a partition may
return a separate exit status. However, these exit status values are
ignored unless a partition analyzer is used to coalesce these separate
exit status values into a final exit status value for the step.

The batch runtime maintains a StepContext clone per partition. For a
partitioned batchlet or chunk, any batch artifact running on any of the
threads processing a partition would merely set a separate exit status
through the StepContext clone. These exit status values are ignored
unless a partition analyzer is used to coalesce these separate exit
status values into a final exit status value for the step.

=== Job XML Substitution

Job XML supports substitution as part of any attribute value. The
following expression language is supported on all attributes:

----
<attribute-value> ::= ' " ' <principle-value-expression>[<default-expression>] ' " '

<principle-value-expression> ::= <value-expression>

<value-expression> ::= "#\{"<operator-expression>"}" | <string-literal>[ <value-expression> ]

<default-expression> ::= ":" <value-expression> ";"

<operator-expression> ::= <operator1> | <operator2> | <operator3> |<operator4> | <operator5>

<operator1> ::= "jobParameters" "[" <target-name> "]"

<operator2> ::= "jobProperties" "[" <target-name> "]"

<operator3> ::= "systemProperties" "[" <target-name> "]"

<operator4> ::= "partitionPlan" "[" <target-name> "]"

<target-name> ::= " ' " <string-literal> " ' "

<string-literal> is a valid XML string value.
----

==== Substitution Processing Rules

Substitution expressions are processed for both initial job start and on
job restart. All substitution expressions must be resolved before the
job can be started or restarted, except for the partitionPlan operator,
which has deferred resolution - see section xref:partitionplan-substitution-operator[8.8.1.4] for more on that.
After substitution expression resolution, the resultant XML document
must be checked for validity, according to the guidelines outlined in
section xref:job-specification-language-2[13], Job Specification Language XSD.

A substitution expression may reference a job parameter or a job
property by specifying the name of the parameter or property through a
substitution expression operator. This name is referred to generally in
substitution expression syntax as a "target name". There are four
substitution operators:

. jobParameters - specifies to use a named parameter from the job
parameters.
. jobProperties - specifies to use a named property from among the
job's properties.
. systemProperties - specifies to use a named property from the system
properties.
. partitionPlan - specifies to use a named property from the partition
plan of a partitioned step.

===== jobParameters Substitution Operator
The jobParameters substitution operator resolves to the value of the
job parameter with the specified target name.

===== jobProperties Substitution Operator
The jobProperties substitution operator resolves to the value of the
job property with the specified target name. This property is found by
recursively searching from the innermost containment scope (this
includes earlier properties within the current scope) to the outermost
scope until a property with the specified target name is found.

E.g. The batch runtime would attempt resolution of the jobProperties
operator specification in each of the two following reader property
definitions by first searching for earlier property definitions within
the reader properties collection, then the step properties collection
(there are none in this example), then the job properties collection (if
any). The search stops at the first occurrence of the specified target
name.

[source,xml]
----
 <job id="job1">
  <properties>
   <property name="filestem" value="postings"/>
   <property name="outputlog" value="jobmessages"/>
 </properties>
 <step id="step1">
  <chunk>
    <reader ref="MyReader">
     <properties>
      <property name="infile.name" value="#\{jobProperties['filestem']}.txt"/>
      <property name="outputlog" value="readermessages"/>
      <property name="outfile.name" value="#\{jobProperties['outputlog']}.txt"/>
     </properties>
    </reader>
  </chunk>
 </step>
</job>
----

The resolved value for reader property "infile.name" would be
"postings.txt".

The resolved value for reader property "outfile.name" would be
"readermessages.txt".

===== systemProperties Substitution Operator

The systemProperties substitution operator resolves to the value of the
system property with the specified target name.

===== partitionPlan Substitution Operator

The partitionPlan substitution operator resolves to the value of the
partition plan property with the specified target name from the
PartitionPlan returned by the PartitionMapper. Partition plan properties
are in scope only for the step to which the partition plan is defined.
The partitionPlan operator is resolved separately for each partition
before the partition execution begins.

E.g. Given job, job1:

[source,xml]
----
<job id="job1">
 <step id="step1">
  <chunk>
   <reader  ref="MyReader>
    <properties>
     <property name="infile.name" value="file#\{partitionPlan['myPartitionNumber']}.txt"/>
     <property name="outfile.name" value="#\{partitionPlan['outFile']}"/>
    </properties>
   </reader>
   <writer ref="MyWriter"/>
  </chunk>
  <partition>
   <mapper ref="MyMapper "/>
  </partition>
 </step>
</job>
----

And MyMapper implementation:

[[app-listing]]
[source,java]
----
public class MyMapper implements PartitionMapper \{
  public PartitionPlan mapPartitions() \{
    PartitionPlanImpl pp= new PartitionPlanImpl();
    pp.setPartitions(2);

    Properties p0= new Properties();
    p0.setProperty("myPartitionNumber", "0");
    p0.setProperty("outFile", "outFileA.txt");

    Properties p1= new Properties();
    p1.setProperty("myPartitionNumber", "1");
    p1.setProperty("outFile", "outFileB.txt");

    Properties[] partitionProperties= new Properties[2];
    partitionProperties[0]= p0;
    partitionProperties[1]= p1;
    pp.setPartitionProperties(partitionProperties);

    return pp;
  }
}
----

The step1 chunk would run as two partitions, with the itemReader
property "infile.name" resolved to "file0.txt" and "file1.txt" for
partitions 0 and 1, respectively. Also, itemReader property
"outfile.name" would resolve to "outFileA.txt", and "outFileB.txt" for
partitions 0 and 1, respectively.

===== Substitution Expression Default

Substitutions expressions may include a default value using the ":"
operator. The default is applied if the substitution's principle value
expression resolves to the empty string "".

===== Property Resolution Rule

Properties specified by a substitution operator must be defined before
they can be used in a substitution expression.

Examples:

_Resolvable Property Reference_

The batch runtime will resolve a substitution reference to a property
that occurs before it is referenced. In the following example, property
"infile.name" is defined before it is used to form the value of property
"tmpfile.name". This is a resolvable reference.E.g.

[source,xml]
----
 <property name="infile.name" value="in.txt" />
 <property name="tmpfile.name" value="#\{jobProperties['infile.name']}.tmp" />
----

The batch runtime resolves a resolvable reference with the resolved
value of the specified property reference.

_Unresolvable Property Reference_

The batch runtime will not resolve a substitution reference to a
property whose first occurrence is after it is referenced. In the
following example, property "infile.name" is defined after it is used to
form the value of property "tmpfile.name". This is a unresolvable
reference.E.g.

[source,xml]
----
 <property name="tmpfile.name" value="in.txt#\{jobProperties[infile.name]}" />
 <property name="infile.name" value="in.txt" />
----

The batch runtime resolves an unresolvable reference in XML to the
empty string "".

===== Undefined Target Name Rule
A substitution expression operator that specifies an undefined target
name is assigned the empty string in XML.

===== Job Restart Rule
Job Parameters may be specified on job restart. Substitution expression
resolution occurs on each restart. This makes it possible for new values
to be used in Job XML attributes during job restart. While all
substitution expressions resolve the same way on restart as on initial
start, there is a special rule for the number of partitions in a
partitioned step:

The number of partitions in a partition plan

The batch runtime determines the number of partitions in a partitioned
step the first time the step is attempted. The batch runtime remembers
that decision and applies it to that step on the next job execution,
once the previous job execution is restarted. The decision cannot be
altered by a substitution expression. The decision can be altered,
however, through a PartitionMapper artifact by specifying the "override"
option in the PartitionPlan object. See section xref:partitionplan[10.9.4] for details on the PartitionPlan class.

==== Examples
[source,xml]
----
       <property name="infile.name" value="in.txt" />
----

Resolved property: infile.name="in.txt"

[source,xml]
----
       <property name="infile.name" value="#\{jobParameters['infile.name']}" />
----

Resolved property: infile.name= value of infile.name job parameter

[source,xml]
----
       <property name="infile.name" value="#\{systemProperties['infile.name']}" />
----

Resolved property: infile.name= value of infile.name system property

[source,xml]
----
       <property name="infile.name" value="#\{jobProperties['infile.name']}" />
----

Resolved property: infile.name= value of infile.name job property

[source,xml]
----
       <property name="infile.name" value="#\{partitionPlan['infile.name']}" />
----

Resolved property: infile.name= value of infile.name from partition
plan for the current partition

[source,xml]
----
       <property name="infile.name" value="#\{jobParameters['infile.name']}:in.txt;" />
----

Resolved property: infile.name = value of infile.name job parameter or
"in.txt" if infile.name job parameter is unspecified.

=== Transitioning Rules

==== Combining Transition Elements

Any combination of transition elements can be included at the end of a
step, flow, or decision definition. Combinations can include zero, one,
or more than one instance of a single type of execution element,E.g.
next.

Transition elements are evaluated in sequential order as they occur
within the JSL document. I.e. the appropriate exit status is compared
with the on attribute value of the first transition element in the
sequence and, if it matches, then the corresponding transition is
perfomed, and the rest of the transition elements are ignored. If not,
the second transition element is evaluated, etc.

Example:
[source,xml]
----
<step id="Step1">
 <next on="RC0" to="Step2"/>
 <next on="RC4" to="Step3"/>
 <end on="RC4" exit-status="DONE"/>
 <fail on="*"/> <!-- Matches anything, so only makes sense as last transition element-->
</step>
----
==== Transitioning Precedence Rules

The transition elements are always "evaluated" first, and if a match is
found, execution transitions accordingly (either to another execution
element or the job is stopped or failed).

If a match is not found among the transition elements (which would
always be the case if there are no transition elements), then transition
proceeds as follows:

1.  If execution resulted in an unhandled exception, then the job ends
with batch status of FAILED.
2.  If execution ended normally, and the execution element whose
execution is completing contains a next attribute, then execution
transitions to the element named by this next attribute value.
3.  If execution ended normally, and the execution element whose
execution is completing does not contain a next attribute, then the job
ends normally (with COMPLETED batch status). For transitioning from a
step within a flow, this statement doesnt apply. See section xref:transitioning-from-within-flows[8.9.4] for
details.

The following examples illustrate how the above rules might be employed:

Example 1: Transition to Step2, unless exit status of RC_ABORT seen, in
which case fail the job

[source,xml]
----
<step id="Step1" next="Step2">
 <fail on="RC_ABORT" exit-status="ABORTED"/>
</step>
----

Example 2: Transition to Step2, but if exception thrown, transition to
RecoveryStep.

[source,xml]
----
<step id="Step1" next="Step2">
<!-- Assumes step exit status defaults to step batch status (FAILED)-->
 <next on="FAILED" to="RecoveryStep"/>
 <fail on="*"/>
</step>
----

Note that the second example shows it is possible for a job to executed
to COMPLETED status, even though a constituent step ends with FAILED
batch status (See section xref:step-exception-handling[8.2.7]).

==== Loop definition

The specification prohibits next and to attribute values that result in
a "loop". More precisely, this means that no execution element can be
transitioned to twice within a single job execution.

This wording is purposely written this way rather than merely saying no
execution element can be executed twice within a single job execution.
Say "step1" executed to completion during an initial execution which
ultimately failed, and upon restart we transitioned past "step1" without
executing it since it had already completed, but we subsequently
transitioned (back) to "step1". This may only be a single execution of
"step1" during a single job execution, but it still violates the looping
prohibition.

The runtime may detect potential loops in an initial validation phase,
as described in section xref:validation-rules[13.1], or may only detect loops once they occur.

==== Transitioning From Within Flows

. As mentioned in section xref:flow[8.3], an execution element which is a child of a
flow may only transition to another execution element within the same
flow. The flows transition elements, however, would transition execution
to the next execution element at the level of the execution scope
containing the flow ,E.g. the job.

. For terminating transitions (stop, end, fail) as well as failures caused
by unhandled exceptions, it is the entire job execution which is
terminated. It is not just the case that the flow alone is somehow
failed or ended yet with another level of transitioning occurring at the
containing (e.g. job) level.

.. Note: transition via next outside of the flow is not permitted. If
this is not detected during job validation (see section xref:validation-rules[13.1]), then at
runtime the job execution will end at this point with batch status of
FAILED.

. When a child of a flow completes normally, and when there are no
matching transition elements as well as no next attribute at the level
of this child of a flow, then the flow ends.

Another way of stating rules #2 and #3 in this section would be to say
that all the rules in section xref:transitioning-precedence-rules[8.9.2] apply to transitions within flows
(i.e. among children of flows) and are effective at the job level,
except for rule #3 in section xref:transitioning-precedence-rules[8.9.2] (this case does not necessarily end
the job).

See the example at the end of section xref:flow-level-transitions-undefined[8.9.5] for further clarification.

==== Flow-level Transitions Undefined

It is recognized that the specification is incomplete with respect to
how exactly flow transition elements are evaluated. Though the list in
section xref:execution-sequence-on-restart-detailed-rules[10.8.4] has an assertion in rule 3.e. that suggests using the
exit status of the last contained execution element as a flow-level exit
status, this does not seem to be a complete definition. For example,
what if the last execution element within the flow is a split

This might be rectified in a later revision of this specification. In
the meantime it is suggested to avoid using flow-level transition
elements in light of this ambiguity.

On the other hand, a transition from a flow via the next attribute of
the flow element is well-defined at the current spec level, and is
suggested.

Example:
[source,xml]
----
<flow id="Flow1" next="StepX">
 <step id="FS1">
 <next on="RC1" to="FS2A"/>
 <next on="RC2" to="FS2B"/>
 <!-- ILLEGAL - would be illegal, since one can only transition within the flow
 <next on="RC3" to="StepX"/>
 -->
 </step>
 <step id="FS2A" >
  <fail on="FAILED"/> <!-- FAILS job, doesn't "fail flow"-->
 </step>
 <step id="FS2B" >
  <fail on="FAILED"/> <!-- FAILS job, doesn't "fail flow"-->
 </step>
 <next on="F*" to="StepY"/> <!-- UNDEFINED -->
</flow>
<step id="StepX">

----

As noted in the comments inline, this example makes the following
points:

* that a child of a flow can only transition to another child of
the same flow (Item 1. in section xref:transitioning-from-within-flows[8.9.4])

* that a terminating transition terminates the job, not just the
flow somehow (Item 2. in section xref:transitioning-from-within-flows[8.9.4])

* that a transition element which is a direct child of the flow
itself is currently UNDEFINED (section xref:flow-level-transitions-undefined[8.9.5])
